# **Executive Summary:**

According to Singapore's Department of Statistics (SingStat),Singapore's total pregnancies accounted a total of 39,039 births in 2018. Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP). Knowing when to have check-ups, what nutrients to have, when and how much exercise is required etc. during pregnancy is important for every pregnant woman.

Pregnant women should mandatorily schedule appointments with a midwife or a doctor (Gynaecologist and Obstetrician) in a specific hospital or clinic as per their preference and ease of access.

The primary aim of the project is to manage the check-up appointments for the user using Robotic Process Automation (RPA). We have automated the process which schedules doctor appointments as per ACOG guidelines automatically with respect to LMP of the user. We have integrated the process with a chatbot for a seamless user interface. The chatbot also assists the pregnant women with answers for their doubts and queries.
